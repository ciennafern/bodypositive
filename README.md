			<p>The first time I made myself throw up was in my freshmen year of college. 

			<p>It was also the year I began to actively research America’s much too harsh, and unsettlingly unachievable social constructs for the woman and her body. 

			<p>The first time I made myself throw up was in my freshmen year of college. 

			<p>It was also the year I began to actively research America’s much too harsh, and unsettlingly unachievable social constructs for the woman and her body. 

			<p>In my very first college research paper I wrote the following:

			<p>“A few months back, I was scrolling through my Instagram feed when I noticed a girl I knew look oddly distorted in her painfully not-so-candid snapshot posted from her tropical spring break vacation destination. Maybe it was the lighting or the odd position she put herself in to enhance her “slimmed” figure, but my friend assured me otherwise. She said to me “There’s an app for that, you know?” I looked at her, confused. “Girls use it all the time to make themselves look skinnier.” I used to think that was something only celebrities did on the covers of Vogue or Cosmo through Photoshop, but today these editing tools are now created for our handheld devices. 

			<p>It really is—as they say— “just the touch of a button.’”

			<p>Through the next 14 pages I ramble discussing the many negative effects social media and advancements in technology has played on our current society’s girls and women, morphing us into terribly phony, photogenic cyborg barbie dolls. 

			<p>I remember constantly (in fact, unfortunately I still do) reminiscing on old photos of myself from the age 16 where my diet consisted of two protein shakes and three hours of gym a day. So as you may have guessed by now my personal body image has—for years—run my life. 

			<p>I mean honestly, who woulda thought you turn 18 and your shoulders broaden and your hips inflate like the mom ass you wish you never had.

			<p>But it’s 2017 right? “The future is woman,” we’re resilient, confident, free, and no one can put us down! ...Except of course, every single it girl that contaminates my social feed. Thanks Kendall for reminding me again that I’m only 5 feet tall and with terribly average features.

			<p>In the past year we’ve seen companies like American Eagle launch their #aeriereal campaign where they stopped photoshopping their models, Lane Bryant’s #ImNoAngel campaign, and publications like Refinery29 who embrace women in broadening the spectrum of sexuality, race, and female body types through their content.  
 
			<p>In hopes of electing the first U.S. female president—regardless of victory or defeat—2016 was undoubtedly a pivotal moment in the lives of American women and girls. However, while signs and encouragement are positive some research shows otherwise. 

			<p>Since 2004 Dove has conducted research that analyzes body confidence and beauty among women and girls globally. They call this the Dove Global Beauty and Confidence Report. 

			<p>The survey which is conducted in 12 countries amongst 6,000 women aged 16 to 84 and 4,500 girls aged 10 to 17 reveals the the lack in global body positivity amongst our women. According to the report, 9 in 10 women and 7 in 10 girls stop themselves from eating and are otherwise putting their health at risk to obtain the narrow beauty ideas forced by mainstream media. 

			<p>“The volume and nature of the media women are exposed to puts huge pressure on them to conform – at both a conscious and unconscious level,” the report states. “Unattainable digitally enhanced images of celebrities and the growing pressure from personal social media channels to perfect their own image are contributing to women’s sense of being ‘landlocked’ by both media and technology.“</p>

			<p>The 2015 feature film, The Illusionists,  produced by Italian filmmaker Elena Rossini explores and gives life to the media’s contagious globalization of beauty. A short synopsis of the film begins by saying “Sex sells. What sells even more? Insecurity.”

			<p>Throughout the 90 minute film  sociologists, politicians, magazine editors, and more from North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia are featured discussing the saturation of global advertising images from leading companies. 

			<p>“We’re losing bodies as fast as we’re losing languages,” British psychotherapist Susie Orbach says in the film. “Just as English has become the lingua franca of the world, so the white, blondified, small-nosed, pert-breasted, long-legged body is coming to stand in for the great variety of human bodies that there are.”

			<p>“I want people to be aware of the problem and that everybody feels this way. That everybody has their own insecurities about our looks because we all have a body, we’re all aging and there’s a whole economy that built around making us feel bad about our bodies”
